# MyBank - A Simple Banking System

MyBank is a simple banking system implemented in Python that allows you to create and manage user accounts, perform transactions, and perform basic data analysis on the bank's customer data. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as file handling, data structures, and basic data analysis.

## Features

- **User Account Management**: MyBank allows you to create and manage user accounts. Each account stores information such as full name, gender, balance, account creation date, city, phone number, age, and country.

- **Transactions**: You can perform transactions between user accounts. Transfer money from one account to another seamlessly.

- **Data Analysis**: MyBank provides basic data analysis capabilities. You can find statistics like the maximum account balance, minimum account balance, average account balance, total balance of all customers, median account balance, variance, and standard deviation of account balances.

- **Graphical Analysis**: Visualize account balances across different countries with graphical analysis using Matplotlib.
